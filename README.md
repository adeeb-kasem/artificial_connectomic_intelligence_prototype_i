# artificial_connectomic_intelligence_prototype_i

# Representation of the complete C. elegans connectome as an artificial neural network.

# This is the basic module only for a neural network. Be sure to replace the filepath for the spreadsheet with the actual filepath on your own device,
# and develop the code further according to your specific needs.

# So far in my code I have represented the C. elegans connectome data in a suitable format for a neural network, defined a "Neuron" class that represents 
# an individual neuron in my network, and created a "Network" class that represents the entire neural network. This suffices for a basic module that is flexible and
# adaptable. Further stages of development (Signal Propagation, Simulation and Training, and Testing and Analysis) are specific to a particular task 
# for which a basic module can be adapted.
